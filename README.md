## 🚀 About the Project

**AstraGuard AI** is an open-source security-focused system that seamlessly combines **AI-assisted threat detection** with **practical offensive security tooling**.

We bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world workflows, making it the perfect platform for students, developers, and early security practitioners to:
- 🛡️ **Test** applications against simulated threats.
- 📊 **Analyze** risks with structured data.
- 🧠 **Understand** vulnerabilities through automated reporting.

The core engine drives the security operations, while our intelligent AI layer handles attack surface analysis, smart payload generation, and guided exploitation (in safe, controlled environments).

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 AI Threat Assistant** | Intelligent analysis of potential vulnerabilities using local LLMs. |
| **🛡️ Offensive Tooling** | A suite of practical security tools for payload generation and testing. |
| **📊 Smart Dashboard** | Real-time visualization of threats and security posture. |
| **🔬 Research Lab** | Integrated lab environment for testing and verifying security hypotheses. |
| **⚡ Real-time Stream** | powered by Pathway for high-performance data processing. |

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ **Build** a stable AI assistant module for smart vulnerability detection.
- ✅ **Create** well-scoped beginner and intermediate issues for contributors.
- ✅ **Improve** documentation and onboarding flows.
- ✅ **Add** automated test pipelines for payload validation.
- ✅ **Ship** a fully working MVP by the end of the program.
